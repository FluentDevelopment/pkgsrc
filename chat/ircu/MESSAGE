The ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} directory where ircd's configuration files live is
currently owned by root with world-readable permissions.

Before attempting to start the server, you should chown(8) that directory
to ${IRCD_USER}:${IRCD_GROUP}, and chmod(8) it to 0700.

You should also create an "ircd.motd" MOTD file for local connect users,
and an "remote.motd" MOTD file for remote users.
