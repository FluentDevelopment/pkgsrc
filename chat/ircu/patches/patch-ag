 So how do you generate these icky looking strings for passwords?
-There's a simple program called mkpasswd to do that for you.  Just run
-mkpasswd, and at the prompt type in your plaintext password.  It will
-spit out the encrypted password, which you should then just copy into
-the irc.conf file. This should be done only when adding new passwords
-to your irc.conf file. To change over your irc.conf file to use
-encrypted passwords, define CRYPT_OPER_PASSWORD in config.h. You will
-need to recompile your server if you already compiled it with this
-feature disabled. Once compiled, edit the Makefile in this directory
-and chang "IRCDCONF" to your irc.conf file. Then "make install" in this
-directory to replace all the operator passwords in your irc.conf file
-with the encrypted format.

 Choose your passwords carefully. Do not choose something in a
 dictionary, make sure its at least 5 characters. Anything past 8
