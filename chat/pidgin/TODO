- Remove silc and sametime options from libpurple and instead provide plugin
  packages e.g. chat/pidgin-silc or chat/libpurple-silc

- options.mk: is this sufficient?
- gstreamer should be a suggested option
- pidgin/Makefile.am, pidgin/Makefile.in should be patched to use an
  already installed libpurple ("pkg-config --libs purple",
  "pkg-config --cflags purple") to avoid the hack of linking libpurple.la
  from the .buildlink directory.
