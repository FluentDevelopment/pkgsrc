ircd-hybrid is now installed.  Do note that three programs have changed
names to more readily reflect their ircd-hybrid function;
make sure to prefix them with "ircd-hybrid":

    convertconf -> ircd-hybrid-convertconf
    mkpasswd -> ircd-hybrid-mkpasswd
    viconf -> ircd-hybrid-viconf

The documentation can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ircd-hybrid.
