DJBDNS is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes several
components:

- dnscache: local DNS cache. It accepts recursive DNS queries from local
  clients. It collects responses from remote DNS servers.
- tinydns: fast, UDP-only DNS server. It makes local DNS information
  available to the Internet.
- pickdns: load-balancing DNS server. It points clients to a dynamic
  selection of IP addresses.
- walldns: reverse DNS wall. It provides matching reverse and forward
  records while hiding local host information.
- dns library: handles outgoing and incoming DNS packets. It can be
  used by clients such as web browsers to look up host addresses, host
  names, MX records, etc. It supports asynchronous resolution.
- dnsfilter: parallel IP-address-to-host-name converter.
- dnsip, dnsip6, dnsipq, dnsname, dnstxt, and dnsmx: simple command-line
  interfaces to DNS.
- dnsq and dnstrace: DNS debugging tools.
