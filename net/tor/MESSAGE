You probably want to install www/privoxy to torify your browsers.  Please
see http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/tor-doc.html for details.

Other applications can be torified with the help of libtsocks (net/tsocks).
A tsocks configuration file for this is installed as
${PREFIX}/share/examples/tor/tor-tsocks.conf.

If you wish to chroot tor, you may find the following URLs helpful:

Security Note:

If you offer a Tor hidden service, an adversary who can run a fast Tor server
and who knows some basic statistics can find the location of your hidden
service in a matter of minutes to hours.

See http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Jan-2006/msg00001.html
for details.

To prevent this information disclosure, manually configure a half dozen
EntryNodes.
