The Multi Router Traffic Grapher is now installed.  Do note that two
programs have changed names to more readily reflect their MRTG-specific
function; make sure to prefix them with "mrtg":

    cfgmaker -> mrtgcfgmaker
    indexmaker -> mrtgindexmaker

The documentation can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mrtg/index.html;
there is a .txt version there as well.

A sample config file collecting various datas from a NetBSD machine can
be found in ${PREFIX}/etc/mrtg/.
