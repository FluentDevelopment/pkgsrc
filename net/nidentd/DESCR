identd that does IPv6, IPv4 and NAT with IPv4.

NOTE: Please do not install this package.  There should be no need to
ever use this; if you think you need this, you really need protocols
which do strong host and/or user authentication such as ssh and IPsec
in conjunction with audit trails.

Note also that this package is a very inefficient shell script which
runs dozens of processes per connection.
