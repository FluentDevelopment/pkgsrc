This is the Perl5 'SNMP' extension module. The SNMP module provides a
full featured, tri-lingual SNMP (SNMPv3, SNMPv2c, SNMPv1) API. The
SNMP module also provides an interface to the SMI MIB parse-tree for
run-time access to parsed MIB data.  The SNMP module internals rely on
the Net-SNMP toolkit library (previously known as ucd-snmp).

The basic operations of the SNMP protocol are provided by this module
through an object oriented interface for modularity and ease of use.
The primary class is SNMP::Session which encapsulates the persistent
aspects of a connection between the management application and the
managed agent. Internally the class is implemented as a blessed hash
reference. This class supplies 'get', 'getnext', 'set', 'fget', and
'fgetnext' and other method calls. The methods take a variety of input
argument formats and support both synchronous and asynchronous
operation through a polymorphic API.
