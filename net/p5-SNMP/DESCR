This is a Perl5 extension module which provides an interface to the
CMU-SNMPv2 library.

The basic operations offered by SNMP are provided through an object
oriented interface for modularity and ease of use. The primary object is
SNMP::Session which is implemented as a blessed hash reference. The
object supports 'get', 'set', and 'getNext' method calls. All calls are
blocking/synchronous (i.e., they must receive a response or timeout
before control is returned to the caller).
