  The pxe daemon has now been installed on your system.  Before starting
  the daemon, please copy ${PREFIX}/share/examples/pxe/pxe.conf to /etc
  and modify according to your needs.

  Under NetBSD-1.5 or above, you can enable pxe on system startup by
  copying ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/pxe to /etc/rc.d and setting pxe=YES
  in your /etc/rc.conf (alternatively, you can simply start
  ${PREFIX}/sbin/pxe in your /etc/rc.local script).
