                    *===* SECURITY NOTES *===*

The users' encrypted passwords stored in

	${SAMBA_ETCDIR}/private/smbpasswd 

are _PASSWORD_EQUIVALENT_ from the viewpoint of SMB protocol.  Do not
weaken the permissions of this file (owned by ${ROOT_USER}:${ROOT_GROUP} and with file
mode rw-------) without any special reasons.

Please note that even if you pkg_delete ${PKGNAME}, pkg_delete will
not remove the smbpasswd file.  If you won't use this package anymore, it
is strongly recommended that you remove the smbpasswd file manually.
