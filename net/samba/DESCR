Samba is a suite of applications that speak the Server Message Block
(SMB) protocol.  Samba allows a UNIX machine to perform client-server
networking for file and printer sharing with Microsoft Windows systems
using their native network protocol and to appear as another Windows
system on the network from the perspective of a Windows client.  The
Samba suite also includes client tools that allow users to access folders
and printers that Windows systems and Samba servers offer on the network.
