The config files for ${PKGNAME} must be located in:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}

and the example files are located in ${EGDIR}.  If you have existing
config files for OpenSSH located at /etc/ssh.conf and /etc/sshd.conf,
then you will have to copy them:

	/etc/ssh.conf  --> ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/ssh_config
	/etc/sshd.conf --> ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sshd_config

You need to create UID sshd, and GID sshd, for privilege separation.  For
security reasons, UsePrivilegeSeparation has to be yes (the default value).
For example, add the following into /etc/passwd and /etc/group:

	sshd:*:16:16::0:0:sshd privsep:/var/chroot/sshd:/sbin/nologin
	sshd:*:16:
