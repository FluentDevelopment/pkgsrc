Kth-krb4 now has been installed on your system.

To complete the installation you'll have to configure Kerberos.
More information on how to configure Kerberos is available via the "info"
command. Sample configuration files are installed in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/kth-krb4.

At a minimum, to configure a Kerberos client, copy 
${PREFIX}/share/examples/kth-krb4/{krb.conf,krb.realms} to /etc and
customize them. Also, apply the patches provided in services-1.4.2.diff
(for NetBSD-1.4.2) or services-1.5.diff (for NetBSD-1.5/1.5.1) 
to /etc/services.
