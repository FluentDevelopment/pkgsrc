If upgrading from SSLeay, you will need to copy your ssleay.cnf (used for
creating certificate requests with "ca") into
${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/openssl.cnf.

If installing from scratch, you may want to take a look
at ${PREFIX}/share/examples/openssl/openssl.cnf copy it
to ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/openssl.cnf, and customize it.
