You will need to also install print/ghostscript-esp{,-nox11} if you wish
to print to non-Postscript printers.

You may want to backup /etc/printcap before starting CUPS for the first
time, as the CUPS scheduler may overwrite this file with automatically
generated content.

Beware:
-------
Whats missing in the docs is that you can install additional PPD files in
${PREFIX}/share/cups/model
and select the model from there.
