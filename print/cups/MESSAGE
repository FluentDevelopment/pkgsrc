READ carefully...

* You NEED to copy the userland print commands into /usr/bin or make sure
  ${PREFIX}/bin/ is in front of the path : 

	mkdir /root/lp-backup
	cp ${PREFIX}/bin/lp* /root/lp-backup
	cp ${PREFIX}/bin/lp* /usr/bin/

* You will need to also install print/ghostscript-esp{,-nox11} if you wish
  to print to non-Postscript printers.

* You may install additional PPD files for other printer models into
 ${PREFIX}/share/cups/model.

* You may want to backup /etc/printcap before starting CUPS for the first
 time, as the CUPS scheduler may overwrite this file with automatically
 generated content.
