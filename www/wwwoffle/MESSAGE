$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.1 2001/11/01 02:19:10 zuntum Exp $

1) To enable "wwwwoffled" to start on boot on NetBSD-1.5 or newer,
please copy "${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/wwwoffled" to "/etc/rc.d/" and add
"wwwoffled=YES" to /etc/rc.conf. To do the same on older systems,
add the following to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/wwwoffle ]; then
    ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/wwwoffle
fi

2) If this was an upgrade, your cache may have been converted and
re-indexed automatically. If not, you may do so by executing the
command "${PREFIX}/sbin/wwwoffle-convert-cache /var/wwwoffle". To
upgrade your wwwoffle.conf file, try the perl script
"${PREFIX}/sbin/wwwoffle-upgrade-config.pl", and also 
"${PREFIX}/sbin/wwwoffle-upgrade-config-2.x-2.5.pl", if required.

3) The hooks are present to to use the package version of "htdig",
if installed, to serve a searchable index of your cached pages.
To make the word database, start "wwwoffle" and execute the script
"/var/wwwoffle/html/search/htdig/scripts/wwwoffle-htdig-full".

4) A complete installation will purge the cache (and optionally
reindex the database for "htdig") periodically, as by the following
example "crontab fragment":

# wwwoffle proxy maintenance
01      1       *       *       0-5     /usr/bin/nice ${PREFIX}/bin/wwwoffle -purge -c ${PREFIX}/etc/wwwoffle/wwwoffle.conf && /bin/sh /var/wwwoffle/html/search/htdig/scripts/wwwoffle-htdig-incr
01      1       *       *       6       /usr/bin/nice ${PREFIX}/bin/wwwoffle -purge -c ${PREFIX}/etc/wwwoffle/wwwoffle.conf && /bin/sh /var/wwwoffle/html/search/htdig/scripts/wwwoffle-htdig-full
