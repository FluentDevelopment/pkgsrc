The database schema was changed between 0.7.x and 0.8. Existing
environments must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac
0.8.  The following command will perform the upgrade:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv upgrade

Trac environments are created with a default set of wiki pages.
It's recommended to update these pages on existing environments
whenever Trac is upgraded to get up-to-date documentation and
additional functionality.  The following command will perform the
update:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv wiki upgrade
