mod_jserv is a module for Apache Server which provides servlet support
using the JSDK version 2.0.  It can also be used with the Jakarta
project's Tomcat servlet environment, which is the next generation of
servlet development from Sun and Apache -- see the jakarta-tomcat
package for details.

Jakarta Tomcat, the apache project's newer Java Servlet and JSP engine
is probably a better choice for new projects. That connector is available
in the ap-jk package. This package is provided for support of existing
JServ users.
