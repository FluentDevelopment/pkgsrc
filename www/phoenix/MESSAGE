PLEASE NOTE: You should create a new profile for Phoenix 0.6.

To create a new profile, start Phoenix by running phoenix -ProfileManager
and click on the "Create Profile" button. If you don't want to delete your
old profile and are willing to incur the risk of new bugs, you should at least
delete your profile's downloads.rdf file.
