The Apache HTTP Server Project is a collaborative software development
effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and
freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server.

This package is IPv6 ready.  The Apache module API is slightly modified,
so some third-party modules may not work.
