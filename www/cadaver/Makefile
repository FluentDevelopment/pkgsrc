# DON'T make this package depend on the www/neon package until neon
# becomes stable; keep it using its internal copy of neon as with
# www/sitecopy.  This package has in the past bounced back and forth
# between using external and internal neon because neon moves faster
# than cadaver, and does so incompatibly.
