To process PHP scripts, you will need a PHP-enabled HTTP server.  You may
either configure the HTTP server to use the PHP CGI binary located in

	${CGIDIR}/php

or you may install a PHP module for your HTTP server, e.g. ap-php4.

Some additional packages you may wish to install are:

	php-dba		DBM database access
	php-iconv	character set conversion

Note that php4-pcre, php4-session and php4-xml are no longer separate
packages since version 4.3.3 because the main PHP4 package has them
built-in now.

Note that php-openssl is no longer a separate package as of version
4.4.0nb2 because the main PHP4 package has it built-in now.
