Please refer to the file:

	${PHPLIBDIR}/README

to setup Horde to access it's database properly.  The short summary is to
edit:

	${PHPLIBDIR}/local.inc
	${PHPLIBDIR}/prepend.php3

to specify the correct backend database, and run the appropriate scripts
in:

	${HORDEDIR}/scripts/databases

to setup the horde database.  Horde is setup by default to access MySQL.
It's recommended that you change the password of the 'hordemgr' user used
to connect to the horde database.  For localhost security, the file

	${PHPLIBDIR}/local.inc

should be accessible only to the webserver process as it contains the
horde database password.

You will also need to make Horde accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf

to make Horde accessible through:
	
	http://www.domain.com/horde/
