    If you would like to install a localized version of Netscape 7, you
    can specify the PKG_LANG environment variable to be one of:

    english (default), french, german, japanese

    Note that this needs to be done *before* you fetch the distfile!

    Furthermore, if you would like to perform a "complete" install rather
    then the default "recommended" install, you can set the variable
    NS_INST to "complete".

    Please note that if you set these variables, you also need to set them 
    as root before running 'make install'!
