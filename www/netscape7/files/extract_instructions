    Now running the Netscape 7 installation program.  Note that the
    installation requires the DISPLAY environment variable to be set.

    1) Choose 'Next' on the first screen

    2) Choose 'Accept' on the End-User License Agreement (EULA)

    3) On the next screen, select your preferred installation and press 'Next'.
       NOTE: Do not alter "Destination Directory"

    4) Click 'Install', lean back and wait while the installer installs
       the necessary files. 

    5) Click 'Ok' on "Installation has completed."

    6) Netscape7 will now start and try to convince you to register with
       Netscape.  It's up to you to do so, but it's not required.  Exit
       Netscape to continue the package installation.
