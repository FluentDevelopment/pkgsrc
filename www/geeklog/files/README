To complete the setup, check and edit @GEEKLOG_DIR@/config.php.

Then you will need to create a MySQL database for geeklog if you install
Geeklog for the first time:

	# @PREFIX@/bin/php @GEEKLOG_EXAMPLESDIR@/createdb.php

You will need to make Geeklog accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to
httpd.conf:

	Include @PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/geeklog.conf

This geeklog.conf assumes that Geeklog would be accessed with "/geeklog"
sub directory.  Since you had better limit the access until complete
Geeklog setup, geeklog.conf limit access to "localhost".  After complete
your setup, please relax this access restriction.

And complete install with:

	http://localhost/geeklog/admin/install/install.php

You can read documentation for install Geeklog:

	http://localhost/geeklog/docs/install.html
