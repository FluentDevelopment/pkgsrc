CSacek recodes the documents on-fly from server code set to the client code
set. It can also recode client data to the server code set, so that other
server modules or CGI programs get the data in one consistent code set.
CSacek can compress the data as sent to client, if client supports it.

Currently supported code sets are the center-europian ones (iso-8859-2,
windows-1250, macce, cp852 & bunch of already obsoleted code sets). There
is also limited support for cyrillic (koi8-r, iso-8859-5, cp866).

Documentation is currently in czech language only.
