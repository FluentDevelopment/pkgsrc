# usage: printindex [brokenfile [brokenbasedir]]
#
# Generates a mapping from pkgsrc directories to the current package
# version and prints it on stdout. Each line of the output has two
# fields: the package directory (in the form category/package) and the
# package version (in the form package-1.456nb3).
#
# If the optional argument <brokenfile> is given, it specifies the
# basename of the file to which package-specific errors will be
# appended.
#
# If the <brokenbasedir> is specified, the complete filename of the
# <brokenfile> is <brokenbasedir>/${pkgdir}/<brokenfile>. This
# directory is created automatically if needed. If the <brokenbasedir>
# is not specified, the <brokenfile> is created in the package directory
# itself.
#
# Note: printindex must be called from a pkgsrc root directory.
