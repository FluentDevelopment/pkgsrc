# usage: printindex [brokenfile [bulkfilesdir]]
#
# Generates a mapping from pkgsrc directories to the current package
# version and prints it on stdout. Each line of the output has two
# fields: the package directory (in the form category/package) and the
# package version (in the form package-1.456nb3).
#
# If <brokenfile> is given, package-specific errors are logged to
# <bulkfilesdir>/${pkgdir}/<brokenfile>. Otherwise no additional logging
# takes place.
#
# The default for <bulkfilesdir> is the pkgsrc directory itself. If
# <bulkfilesdir> differs from the pkgsrc directory, all directories
# that are needed for the log files are created automatically.
#
# Note: printindex must be called from a pkgsrc root directory.

# files are created if necessary.
