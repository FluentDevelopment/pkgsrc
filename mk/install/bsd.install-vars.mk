# or gzip to decompress or compress the installed man pages.  If a

# to the install code that the package itself installed the man pages
# either compressed or uncompressed.  If a package sets
# MANCOMPRESSED_IF_MANZ, then the package uses BSD-style makefiles,
# so we need to determine if the BSD-style makefile causes the man
# pages to be compressed or not.
