# This file provides the following targets:
#
# bin-install
#	Tries to install a package from a prebuilt binary package, and
#	if that doesn't work, builds the package from source.
#
# The following variables can be set by the pkgsrc user in mk.conf:
#
# PACKAGES
#	This directory is searched before BINPKG_SITES when trying to
#	install binary packages.
#
# BINPKG_SITES
#	A list of URLs where binary packages can be found.
#	See mk/defaults/mk.conf for details.

# List of sites carrying binary pkgs. Variables "rel" and "arch" are
# replaced with OS release ("1.5", ...) and architecture ("mipsel", ...)
