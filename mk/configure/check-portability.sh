#
# This program checks the extracted files for portability issues that
# are likely to result in false assumptions by the package.
#
# The most prominent example is the "==" operator of test(1), which is
# only implemented by bash and some versions of the ksh.
#
# Note: because this program is run with the tools wrapper directory in
# the PATH, it calls the utilities by their base names. It also assumes
# to be interpreted by a POSIX-conforming shell.
