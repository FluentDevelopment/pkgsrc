  OpenOffice has now been installed in ${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org${VER}.

  Before using this package for the first time, each user has to run
  a setup program, which is automatically invoked at the first start of 
  ${PREFIX}/bin/soffice.

  For (optional) Java support, please run 
  ${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org${VER}/program/jvmsetup
  after having run the user setup program.
