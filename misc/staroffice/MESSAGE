  StarOffice has now been installed in ${PREFIX}/Office51.

  Before using this package for the first time, each user has to run
  ${PREFIX}/bin/sosetup.  Thereafter, StarOffice can be started using
  the ${PREFIX}/bin/soffice command.

  Please note that under NetBSD the program will pop up a requester,
  complaining that it is unable to load the 'PluginManager' component.
  This is normal and can be ignored (you can simply click away the
  requester).
