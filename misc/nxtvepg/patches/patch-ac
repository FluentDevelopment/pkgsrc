 If you're using an acquisition daemon, the browser must be configured to use the same directory as the daemon.  If the daemon is running on a different host, you need to mount the remote directory, e.g. via NFS.

 Specify which TV card hardware to use, if you have more than card. Default: index 0. On Linux the given index is appended to the device names, i.e. } {} {/dev/vbi} underlined { and } {} {/dev/video} underlined {. On Windows index "n" means the n-th card found while scanning the PCI bus for cards with a Bt878, Bt878A, Bt848 or Bt849 chip.  If you have more than one TV card with the same chip, the order between those is undefined, but still constant (i.e. the order is determined by the driver, not nxtvepg)
