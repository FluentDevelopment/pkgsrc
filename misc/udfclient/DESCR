UDFclient is a userland implementation of the UDF filingsystem as defined by
the OSTA group. UDFclient is designed to be a study platform and a run-up to a
full read and write kernel level implementation.

UDFclient basically provides a user interface not unlike ftp(1) but always
fetches files recursively from the disc(s).

Version 0.20 is a renewed and sanitised version pending write support... Mainly
bug fixes and improved reading support.
