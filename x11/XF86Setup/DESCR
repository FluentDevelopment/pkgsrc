XF86Setup is a new program to aid in the configuration of the XFree86
servers. It is unlike previous programs (such as ConfigXF86 and
xf86config) in that it is specifically designed to do as much as
possible while in graphics mode.

XF86Setup requires that both the VGA16 and card-appropriate servers be
installed. Furthermore, the servers must include the XKEYBOARD,
XFree86-VidModeExtension, and XFree86-Misc extensions. If the dialog
program is installed, it will be used, but is not required.
