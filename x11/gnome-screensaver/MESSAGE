In order to get gnome-screensaver working properly, you need to add a
gnome-screensaver file to your pam configuration directory (usually
/etc/pam.d).  You can find sample files in:

	${EGDIR}/pam.d/gnome-screensaver

The "floating feet" animation needs librsvg (from pkgsrc/graphics/librsvg2)
to read its graphics file.
