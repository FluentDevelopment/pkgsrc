Make sure you have defined X11BASE in /etc/mk.conf before try to install 
pkgtools/x11-links. Then you can just add the following:

	X11BASE=${X11PREFIX}/X11R6

If you had previously installed x11-links, make sure you have modified 
X11BASE and then reinstalled x11-links before building any X11 
application.
