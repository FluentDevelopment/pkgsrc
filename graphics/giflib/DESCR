Giflib is a GIF manipulation library and tools.  Note that this package
has potential patent problems: giflib incorporates the LZW compression
algorithm whose patent is currently held by Unisys.

The tools include programs to clip, rotate, scale, and position
GIF images.  It includes code to dump GIFs to an Epson-compatible printer
in graphics mode, and several conversion utilities.

The library includes program-callable entry points for reading and writing
GIF files, an 8x8 utility font for embedding text in GIFs, and an error
handler.  GIF manipulation can be done at a relatively low level by
sequential I/O (which automatically does/undoes image compression) or at
a higher level by slurping an entire GIF into allocated core.
