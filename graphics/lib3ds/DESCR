Lib3ds is a free alternative to Autodesk's 3DS File Toolkit for handling 3DS
files.  Its main goal is to simplify the creation of 3DS import and export
filters.

This project is not related in any form to Autodesk.  The library is based on
unofficial information about the 3DS format found on the web.
