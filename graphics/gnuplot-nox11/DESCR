Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
for UNIX, MSDOS, and VMS platforms.  The software is copyrighted but
freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it).  It was
originally intended as graphical program which would allow scientists
and students to visualize mathematical functions and data.  Gnuplot
supports many different types of terminals, plotters, and printers
(including many color devices, and pseudo-devices like LaTeX) and is
easily extensible to include new devices.  [ The "GNU" in gnuplot is
NOT related to the Free Software Foundation, the naming is just a
coincidence (and a long story). Thus gnuplot is not covered by the Gnu
copyleft, but rather by its own copyright statement, included in all
source code files.]
