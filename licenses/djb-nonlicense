Many software packages written by Dan Bernstein do not have licenses.
As such, these packages cannot be considered OSI Certified Open
Source Software. This may impact you if, for instance, your company's
legal department mandates that only licensed software be used.

Bernstein's rationale for not placing his software under a license is
described at "Software user's rights":

Bernstein's redistribution conditions are described at "Frequently
asked questions from distributors":

The pkgsrc team warrants that we have made a good-faith attempt to
ensure that our packages of Bernstein's software behave correctly
and meet his redistribution conditions.
