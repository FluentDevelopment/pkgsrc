NOTE:  Because plex86 contains a kernel module, it must be run with a
kernel built from the same sources as the plex86 binaries.  If you are
running a system with changing kernel sources (such as NetBSD-current),
you must recompile and reinstall plex86 after compiling your kernel from
updated sources.  (Be sure to disable the LKM while doing this!)

In order to enable loading of the plex86 kernel module at boot time,
edit /etc/lkm.conf and add the following line:

${PREFIX}/lkm/plex86.o - - ${PREFIX}/lib/plex86/netbsd_post.sh - AFTERMOUNT

The module will be loaded after reboot, and the netbsd_post.sh script will
automatically create the needed /dev/plex86 device.
