You should update the virus databases to the latest ones available
before using ClamAV.  This can be done by running the following command
as `${ROOT_USER}' or `${CLAMAV_USER}':

	${PREFIX}/bin/freshclam

It is recommended that the virus database be updated hourly by adding the
appropriate cron job.
