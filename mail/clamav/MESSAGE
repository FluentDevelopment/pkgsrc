You should update the virus databases to the latest ones available
before using ClamAV.  This can be done by running the following command
as `${ROOT_USER}' or `${CLAMAV_USER}':

	${PREFIX}/bin/freshclam

It is recommended that the virus database be updated hourly by adding the
appropriate cron job.

Note that as of version 0.80, clamav.conf has been replaced by
clamd.conf. Be sure to update your configuration to reflect this.
