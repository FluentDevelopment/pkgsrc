To activate ${PKGBASE} for local and outgoing deliveries:
- Check the configuration files in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}.
- Modify /etc/mailer.conf (see ${EGDIR}/mailer.conf).
- Set qmailsend=YES in /etc/rc.conf.

To enable SMTP:
- Set qmailsmtpd=YES in /etc/rc.conf.

To enable POP3 (only for Maildirs):
- Set qmailpop3d=YES in /etc/rc.conf.

To allow local non-root users to see the queue:
- Set qmailqread=YES in /etc/rc.conf.
- Change the mailq entry in /etc/mailer.conf to qmail-qread-client.

Alternatively, you can manage the qmail daemons with daemontools
by creating appropriate run scripts in /service. There are many
ways to do this; you may find the qmail-conf package helpful.
