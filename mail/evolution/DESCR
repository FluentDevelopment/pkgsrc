  Ximian Evolution(TM) is the premier personal and workgroup information
management solution for Linux and UNIX. The software seamlessly
integrates email, calendaring, meeting scheduling, contact management
and online task lists in one powerful, fast, and easy to use
application.

  The message composer currently does not work under NetBSD.  Also,
please note that Evolution uses a huge number of resources.  Make
sure you increase user and kernel limits for open files and processes
if you run into trouble!
