$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.4 2003/04/15 00:02:24 heinz Exp $

***IMPORTANT***

  Version 2.53 changes the default tagging behavior. SpamAssassin will now
  create a new report message and attach the original spam message as a
  MIME part (use the "report_safe" option to change this).

  Some configuration options were changed (see Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf).
  Please check that your existing mail configuration still works.

  On NetBSD, the name of the auto-whitelist database file has changed and
  the auto-whitelist will be created from scratch.

  SpamAssassin does NOT deliver mail anymore. You _must_ use some local
  mail delivery agent, eg pkgsrc/mail/procmail.

More information can be found in the man pages for 'spamassassin',
'sa-learn', 'spamc' and 'spamd', with 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'
and in

  ${PREFIX}/share/doc/spamassassin/
