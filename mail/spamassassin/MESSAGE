***IMPORTANT***

  Starting with version 2.40 SpamAssassin does NOT deliver mail anymore.
  If you relied on spamassassin to write the mail into your mail folder,
  you'll have to change your setup to use some local mail delivery agent,
  e.g. pkgsrc/mail/procmail.

More information can be found in 
  ${PREFIX}/share/doc/spamassassin/

and via 'man spamassassin' and 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'
