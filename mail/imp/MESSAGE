Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/imp/SECURITY

on how to secure the IMP installation.  It is at least recommended that
you change the default database password used by horde-phplib and imp.
You may setup the Horde/IMP installation by pointing a web browser at:

	http://www.domain.com/horde/setup.php3

or by manually editting:

	${IMPDIR}/config/defaults.php3

You will also need to make IMP accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following lines
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf
	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/imp.conf

to make Horde accessible through:
	
	http://www.domain.com/horde/imp/
