IMP is a set of PHP scripts that implement an IMAP based webmail system.
Assuming you have an account on a server that supports IMAP, you can use
an installation of IMP to check your mail from anywhere that you have web
access.
This is the previous stable branch of IMP.  A version of IMP using the
current stable branch is available as mail/imp4.
