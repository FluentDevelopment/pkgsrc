If you want to use the spell checking feature of pine, set the
environment variable SPELL to "${PREFIX}/bin/ispell -l".

The optional configuration file "${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/pine.conf" can be
used to set system wide defaults.  The format of this file is identical
to the .pinerc file that is auto-generated by pine in your home directory.

Also included in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/pine/dot.pinerc.pgp.sample are
example entries needed to add to your .pinerc to activate the pgp add on
scripts pgpdecode, pgpencode, and pgpsign.
