There are two incompatible changes from 2.x.

	Mbox delivery is now accomplished via an external MDA including
	getmail_mbox, which is included in this version of getmail.
	It assumes mboxrd format and flock locking. Use with care.

	The recipient_header directive is renamed to "envelope_recipient".
	You might have to update your getmailrc.
