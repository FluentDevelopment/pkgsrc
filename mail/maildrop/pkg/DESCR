maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent.  maildrop
reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to your
mailbox.  maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style mailboxes, and
maildirs.  "maildir" is a mailbox format used by the Qmail MTA.

maildrop will optionally read instructions from a file, which describes
how to filter incoming mail.  Instructions can be provided having mail
delivered to alternate mailboxes, or forwarded somewhere else.  Unlike
procmail, maildrop uses a structured filtering language.
