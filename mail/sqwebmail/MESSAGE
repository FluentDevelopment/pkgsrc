You must create a cron job that runs at regular intervals (one hour is
fine) that executes the following Perl script to clean the SqWebMail
user cache:

    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/cleancache.pl

You will need to make SqWebMail accessible through your HTTP server by
making URLs with path "${IMAGEURL}/" resolve to the images in
${IMAGEDIR}.

For Apache, you can add the following to httpd.conf:

    <IfModule mod_alias.c>
        Alias ${IMAGEURL}/ "${IMAGEDIR}/"
    </IfModule>

Also, certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer have a bug in their
HTTP/1.1 protocol implementation that results in errors when downloading
attachments.  You should configure your HTTP server to force a HTTP/1.0
protocol response for MSIE clients, e.g. for Apache, add the following to
httpd.conf:

    BrowserMatch "MSIE [45]" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

Maildir accounts will be accessible through:

    http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/sqwebmail

If you're using a non-default sendmail program, you will need to edit:

    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sendit.sh

To use GPG with SqWebMail, you will need to install the security/gnupg
package and you should read the documentation at:

    ${PREFIX}/share/doc/courier/sqwebmail/README.gpg.html
