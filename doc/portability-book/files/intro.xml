<title>Introduction</title>

<para>Writing programs that are portable to a wide range of platforms
isn't easy. Maybe some platforms are lacking your favorite tool, while
others implemented it, but with arbitrary limitations. Some don't have
such useful functions like <funcname>snprintf</funcname> or
<funcname>strlcpy</function>.</para>

<para>This book provides information about which features are
<emphasis>not</emphasis> on the platforms, since the features that
<emphasis>are</emphasis> available are already documented quite well. It
also explains how portable shell programs look like, since that's also a
topic that hasn't spread wide yet.</para>

<para>Since pkgsrc uses the POSIX tools quite a lot, and the packages
using all other features, it's good to know on which platforms a certain
program will not work without further work.</para>
