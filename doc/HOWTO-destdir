DESTDIR support
---------------

A growing number of packages support installation into a subdirectory of
WRKDIR. This allows a package to be built, before the actual filesystem
is touched. DESTDIR support exists in two variations:

- basic DESTDIR support means that the package installation and
packaging is still run as root.

- full DESTDIR support can run the complete build, installation and
packaging as normal user. Root privileges are only needed to add
packages.

To use the DESTDIR support, set either USE_DESTDIR=yes to use the basic
support for packages that offer it or USE_DESTDIR=full to get the full
support with fallback to basic support. USE_DESTDIR=full needs a
pkg_install of 20070802. It might become the default DESTDIR support
later.

This changes the behaviour of various targets slightly. To install a
package after building it, use package-install. package and install
don't do that any longer. package-install can be used as DEPENDS_TARGET.
bin-install will ask for the root password to install the package and
fail, package-install will ask again.

With basic DESTDIR support, make clean needs to be run as root.


Adding DESTDIR support to packages
----------------------------------

- all installation operations have to be prefixed with ${DESTDIR}

- automake gets this mostly right, manual rules and pre/post-install
often not --> fix thix

- if files are installed with special owner/group either use
@owner/@group in the PLIST (prefered) or use SPECIAL_PERMS
(discouraged). Note that @owner/@group are stic during install, keep
this in mind.

- in general, package should support UNPRIVILEGED to be able to use
DESTDIR.
