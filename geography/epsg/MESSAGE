Before the EPSG data can be used, it must be installed into a
relational database.  The data files are installed in ${EPSGDIR}.  For
an example script that will install the data, see ${EGDIR}/epsg.

See the following two documents, which are located in ${DOCDIR},
for a complete description of the dataset.

	Using the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset (Surveying and
	Positioning Guidance Note Number 7, part 1)

	Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas
