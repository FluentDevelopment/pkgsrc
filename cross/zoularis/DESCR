This package provides the necessary header files and libraries to
install NetBSD utilities and libraries on Solaris 2.8, Redhat Linux
6 and 7, and has been used to get the NetBSD packages collection
working on Solaris and Linux. It was developed by Christos Zoulas,
and has been tested on Solaris 2.8, running on Sparc hardware, and
RedHat Linux 7.0, running on i386 hardware.

To get this package running on Solaris, you'll need to have either
a recent gcc or egcs installed, and a version of GNU tar available,
as well as gzip.

After extracting all the files, you need to edit Makefile.inc to set
the correct paths for ${BSDSRCDIR} (where the NetBSD src tree is
located), and for ${DESTDIR} (where the binaries and support files
will be placed). 

On Solaris then, make sure that /usr/ccs/bin is in your path,
and then invoke Solaris' make (/usr/ccs/bin/make).

There is nothing special to do on Linux.
