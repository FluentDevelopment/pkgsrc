GNU text utilities

The Free Software Foundation's text processing utilities, for
rearranging, reformatting and generally mangling text.

Many of the utilities exist in the NetBSD base system, but the GNU
versions have added functionality, which is sometimes useful.  The GNU
text utilities are mostly compatible with the POSIX.2 standard.

Note that the texinfo documentation refers to these utilities
without the "g" prefix (cat rather than gcat, etc.).
