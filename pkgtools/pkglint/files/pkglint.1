.Sh NAME
.Nm pkglint
.Nd a verifier for pkgsrc directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkglint
.Op Fl options
.Op Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
attempts to detect features of the named pkgsrc packages that are likely
to be bugs, or that are simply deprecated.
The pkgsrc system is changing rapidly towards even more portability.
The job of
.Nm
is to define the rules that make up
.Dq good
packages and to allow automatic conformance tests.
Packages following these rules are assumed to make future changes to the
pkgsrc infrastructure easier.
