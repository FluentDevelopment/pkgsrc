     ppkkgglliinntt tries to verify the content of a pkgsrc directory.  The purpose
     of ppkkgglliinntt can be separated into two parts: (1) to let the submitters
     easily polish her/his own pkgsrc directory, and (2) to decrease the labor
     of the committers.

     ppkkgglliinntt uses very simple regular-expression matching for verifying files
     that make up a pkgsrc directory.  Note that it does NOT implement a com-
     plete parser for those files.  Because of this the user may see some
     extra warnings, especially when checking complex _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_es.

     --BB _n        Set the number of contiguous blank lines allowed in _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e
                 to _n (by default, _n is 1.)

     --hh          Show the summary of command line options, then exit.

     --II          Show the Makefile that is constructed by including all the
                 files that are slurped in via .include directives.  This flag
                 is mainly for debugging.

     --NN          New package flag.  Adds several checks specific to newly sub-
                 mitted packages.  If you are willing to submit the directory
                 to be checked as a new package, use this option.

     --vv          Be verbose.  Show the progress report for items that are
                 being checked.

     dir         The pkgsrc directory to be checked.  If omitted, all checks
                 will be performed on the current directory.

     Messages will be sent to standard output, not standard error.

     FATAL: ...    This type of error messages suggests that there is some
                   fatal error in the pkgsrc directory.  For example, if some
                   files need a rewrite, or if some necessary files are miss-
                   ing, this message will show up.  This kind of error should
                   be fixed BEFORE submitting a pkgsrc via send-pr to the
                   comitters.

     WARN: ...     This type of error messages suggests that some files may
                   (or may not) need some fixes.  Basically, warnings are pro-
                   duced when ppkkgglliinntt is not completely sure about the result.
                   For example, complex _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_es may need some statements
                   that can match the regular expression ppkkgglliinntt uses for san-
                   ity checks.  In those cases, the user should evaluate the
                   result manually, and obey/ignore the result.

     OK: ...       This type of messages is used in verbose mode (--vv).

     ppkkgglliinntt is not a magic wand, as described above.
