.Sh NAME
.Nm createbuildlink
.Nd automatic pkgsrc buildlink2.mk generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl j
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads in the
.Pa Makefile
and
.Pa PLIST
of a package and creates
an initial
.Pa buildlink2.mk
file on stdout.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl j
Join together all .h files in an include directory and list as *.h.
Be careful with this option and only use it if you are sure that the
package in question is the only one providing header files in the PLISTed
directory.
.El
.Pp
While
.Nm
is supposed to help starting create a
.Pa buildlink2.mk
for a package, it is not intended to fly on autopilot.
That means that while the script makes some simplistic attempts
to interpret some elements of the
.Pa Makefile
and the
.Pa PLIST
such as the contents of the include and lib subdirectories or
package config scripts, the results should not be put into a
package directory without some scrutiny.
.Pp
Using
.Nm
helps maneuver through the initial process of creating a
.Pa buildlink2.mk
file for a package to be included by depending packages.
Using
.Nm
is less error-prone than copying an existing
.Pa buildlink2.mk
as a template and renaming the entries in there.
