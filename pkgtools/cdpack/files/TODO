To-Do List for cdpack
---------------------


- extract COMMENT and DESCR to generate a browseable index of all the 
  packages on the CD set.  This would be similar to the README.html's
  in pkgsrc, but with some modifications.   The changes would be to
  list which CD certain pkgs are on.  Also, if a DEPENDS is not on the
  CD set (due to redistribution restrictions for example), perhaps
  list that so the user knows s/he must install the restricted DEPENDS
  by hand first.

- come up with some sort of install tool around pkg_add.  Perhaps this 
  could be done using SUSHI.  The idea would be to let the user browse
  the selection of packages, select some subset of them and then do
  a batch install.
