This is the first release of "Kaffe OpenVM", a complete virtual machine
and class library set which allows the execution of Java code without any
code from Javasoft.  It comes with a virtual machine and a set of class
libraries including beans, and the all important AWT graphics system.

Running Kaffe
=============
Before running Kaffe it is necessary to configure the environment.
This requires the setting of PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For the standard installation these would be defined as follows:

	PATH=$PATH:/${PREFIX}/kaffe/bin
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${PREFIX}/kaffe/lib

Note that you don't have to setup the CLASSPATH - if you do then that's
fine, but if you don't Kaffe will cosntruct a classpath from the Jar and Zip
files it finds in the standard places (the default would be to include all
files in ${PREFIX}/kaffe/share/kaffe).

The value ${PREFIX} above is whatever LOCALBASE is set to in the
environment, or in /etc/mk.conf, when the package was installed on
NetBSD.  By default this is /usr/pkg.
