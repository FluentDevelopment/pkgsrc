Before running Kaffe it is necessary to configure the environment.
This requires the setting of PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For the standard installation these would be defined as follows:

	PATH=$PATH:/${PREFIX}/bin
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${PREFIX}/lib

Note that you don't have to setup the CLASSPATH - if you do then that's
fine, but if you don't Kaffe will construct a classpath from the Jar and
Zip files it finds in the standard places (the default would be to include
all files in ${PREFIX}/share/kaffe).
