Before running Kaffe it is necessary to configure the environment.
This requires the setting of PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For the standard installation these would be defined as follows:

	PATH=$PATH:/${PREFIX}/java/kaffe/bin
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${PREFIX}/java/kaffe/lib

Note that you don't have to setup the CLASSPATH - if you do then that's
fine, but if you don't Kaffe will construct a classpath from the Jar and Zip
files it finds in the standard places (the default would be to include all
files in ${PREFIX}/java/kaffe/share/kaffe).
