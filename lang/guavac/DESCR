Guavac is a compiler for the Java language, written by Effective Edge
Technologies and distributed under the Gnu Public License.  You should feel

We are distributing guavac free of charge in the hopes that other people will

Guavac should produce correct bytecode for valid Java input, but you may
encounter some difficulties in compiling guavac itself, due inadequate
tools on some platforms.
