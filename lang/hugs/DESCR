The Nottingham and Yale Haskell interpreter and programming environment.

   Nottingham and Yale are pleased to announce a new release of Hugs,
   a Haskell interpreter and programming environment for developing
   cool Haskell programs.  Sources and binaries are freely available
   by anonymous FTP and on the World-Wide Web.

   This release is largely conformant with Haskell 1.4, including
   monad and record syntax, newtypes, strictness annotations, and
   modules.  In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined
   in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report and with
   extension libraries which are compatible with GHC 3.0.

   Hugs is best used as a Haskell program development system: it boasts
   extremely fast compilation, supports incremental compilation, and
   has the convenience of an interactive interpreter (within which one
   can move from module to module to test different portions of a
   program).  However, being an interpreter, it does not nearly match
   the run-time performance of, for example, GHC or HBC.
