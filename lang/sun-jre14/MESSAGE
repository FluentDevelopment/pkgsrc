In order to invoke the JVM, the data segment size set by your
shell's 'ulimit' builtin must be at least 131204 -- please refer
to your shell's manual page for details.

You may want to read ${JDK_HOME}/README for details about running
this jdk. In a nutshell you may want to set the following in your
shell environment:

	JAVA_HOME to ${JDK_HOME}
	${PATH} to include ${JDK_HOME}/bin
