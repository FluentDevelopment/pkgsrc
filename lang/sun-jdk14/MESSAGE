In order to be able to run the JVM, you will need to compile your kernel
with the following options:

makeoptions     TEXTADDR=d0100000
options         KERNBASE_LOCORE=0xd0000000
options         COMPAT_LINUX

Furthermore, the data segment size set by your shell's 'ulimit' builtin must
be at least 131204 -- please refer to your shell's manual page for details.
