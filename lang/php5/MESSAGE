To process PHP scripts, you will need a PHP-enabled HTTP server.  You may
either configure the HTTP server to use the PHP CGI binary located in

        ${CGIDIR}/php

or you may install a PHP module for your HTTP server, e.g. ap-php5.

Note that php-openssl is no longer a separate package as of version
5.0.5nb1 because the main PHP5 package has it built-in now.
