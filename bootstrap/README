To try to get pkgsrc working on your system, please try the following
as root:

# ./bootstrap 
    [ --workdir <workdir> ]
    [ --prefix <prefix> ]
    [ --pkgdbdir <pkgdbdir> ]
    [ --sysconfdir <sysconfdir> ]
    [ --varbase <varbase> ]
    [ --ignore-case-check ]
    [ --ignore-user-check ]
    [ --preserve-path ]
    [ --help ]

The defaults for the arguments are as follows:

	--prefix	/usr/pkg
	--pkgdbdir	/var/db/pkg
	--sysconfdir	/usr/pkg/etc
	--varbase	/var
	--workdir	work

It is perfectly acceptable to place 'pkgdbdir' under 'prefix'.

The working directory will be created if it doesn't exist and has to be
writable by the user executing ./bootstrap.

Make sure that you have a working C compiler and make(1) binary in
your path.  Please note that on some systems (IRIX and SunOS, for example),
the bootstrap script will look into a number of common directories for
alternative implementations of some tools.  If they are found, these
directories will be prepended to the PATH variable, unless the
'--preserve-path' flag is given.

See http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html for
more information about bootstrapping and using pkgsrc.

We'd be very interested in hearing of any successes or failures on
"unknown" (to us) systems.
