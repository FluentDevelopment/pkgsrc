To try to get pkgsrc working on your system, please try the following
as root:

# ./bootstrap [ --prefix=${PREFIX} ] [ --pkgdbdir=${PKGDBDIR} ] \
	[ --pkgsrcdir=${PKGSRCDIR} ] [ --sysconfdir=${PKG_SYSCONFBASE} ] \
	[ --workdir=working directory] \
	[ --ignore-case-check ] [ --ignore-user-check ] [ --help ]

The defaults for the arguments are as follows:

	--prefix	/usr/pkg
	--pkgdbdir	/var/db/pkg
	--pkgsrcdir	/usr/pkgsrc
	--sysconfdir	/usr/pkg/etc
	--workdir	work

It is perfectly acceptable to place ${PKGDBDIR} under ${PREFIX}.

The working directory will be created if it doesn't exist and has to be
writable by the user executing ./bootstrap.

Make sure that you have a working C compiler and make(1) binary in
your path.

See http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html for
more information about bootstrapping and using pkgsrc.

We'd be very interested in hearing of any successes or failures on
"unknown" (to us) systems.
