WHAT IS X-BOMBER?

  X-Bomber is a multiplayer game for the X-Window system.  The concept is
  loosely based on the game "Super Bomberman" for the Super Nintendo
  game system.

  Up to four players can play simultaneously.  The game runs as one client
  which connects to multiple X displays (servers).
