Libao is a cross-platform audio library that allows programs to
output audio using a simple API on a wide variety of platforms.
libao currently supports:
   * Null output
   * WAV files
   * OSS (Open Sound System)
   * ESD (ESounD or Enlighten Sound Daemon)
   * ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
   * Solaris (untested)
   * IRIX (untested)

This package provides the libao's core library but no output plugins
by itself.  You will have to install some of the libao-* packages in
order to get audio working.
