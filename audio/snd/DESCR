Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs and an old, sorely-missed
PDP-10 sound editor named Dpysnd. It can accomodate any number of sounds at
once, each with any number of channels. Each channel is normally displayed
in its own window, with its own cursor, edit history, and marks; each sound
has a 'control panel' to try out various changes quickly, and an expression
parser, used mainly during searches; there is an overall stack of 'regions'
that can be browsed and edited; channels and sounds can be grouped together
during editing; edits can be undone and redone without restriction
('unlimited undo'); Snd can be customized using an Emacs-lisp-like syntax;
it can also be extended with user-supplied editing or display functions
loaded at run time; and it's free; the code is available via anonymous ftp
from ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu as pub/Lisp/snd.tar.gz.
