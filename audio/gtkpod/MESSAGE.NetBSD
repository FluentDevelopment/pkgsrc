If you are running a version of NetBSD earlier than 3.0 and mounting your
iPod via USB, you need at least version 1.130 of usb_subr.c.  3.0 and later
include the fix.
===========================================================================
Before uncabling your iPod, use the 'eject' command to turn off the
"do not disconnect" message.
