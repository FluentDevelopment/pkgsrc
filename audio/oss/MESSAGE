To use OSS, you will need a kernel built with the LKM option enabled, e.g.
GENERIC, GENERIC_LAPTOP.

You should also initially run "soundconf" as root to detect and configure
and system soundcard(s), and to install a permanent license for OSS.

There is an "oss" rc.d script that may be used to control the loading and
unloading of the OSS LKM.
