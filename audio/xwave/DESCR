This is an alpha release, so be patient.
Many of the features i wanted to include are not there at this time.
I have not heavy tested the installation and xwave on different systems,
so it is possible that xwave will not compile or run on your system.

I have used some libs from other authors, the copyrights and notes are in
the different directories.

The Userinterface of xwave is based on the Athena Widget Set and some
Widgets from FWF. The application defaults are optimized for work with
Xaw3d (replaces the Xaw for 3d look), 
so if you don't use Xaw3d you will probably modify the resources. 

Features:
	- multiple files
	- overview window 
	- zoom window
	- mark, cut, copy, paste, merge
	- echo, reverse, swap, resample, volume (absolute, dynamic
	  compressor)
	- stop record on demand
	- raw, wav, au, aiff, aifc (PCM,ALAW,ULAW,ADPCM <- not all
	  implementations)
	- files of every length

INSTALL:
	If your /tmp is too small for handling temporary files, set
	the X ressource XWave*tdir to some big directory (Either in
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XWave or your ~/.Xdefaults)
