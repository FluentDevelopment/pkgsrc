Memtest86+ is a standalone program, it does not run within an operating
system.  It has been designed to boot from a PC floppy disk.  To install
Memtest86 on a floppy, insert a disk then type:
	dd if=${PREFIX}/mdec/memtestplus.bin of=/dev/rfd0a conv=osync

If you have built the optional .iso file, you can use cdrtools to
burn it to a CD.

The documentation claims that the .bin file can be booted by LILO; I have
not tested that.

Please read the documentation at:
