xcdroast creates its config file into ${PREFIX}/etc/xcdroast.conf.
It will not get removed with pkg_delete(1) automatically. So if you no longer
intend to use this package don't forget to remove it by hand.
xcdroast doesn't work as SUID program if linked against gtk-1.2.9. Other
options include making cdrecord SUID or using a wrapper like sudo.
