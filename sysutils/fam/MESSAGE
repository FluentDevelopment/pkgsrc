FAM uses RPC and is usually started by the inetd(8) superserver.  You need
to enable it manually, by issuing the following steps:

1) Add FAM to the system's portmapper by appending the following line to
   the /etc/rpc file:

        sgi_fam    391002    fam    # File Alteration Monitor

2) Add FAM to the system's superserver by appending the following line to
   the /etc/inetd.conf file:

        sgi_fam/1-2 stream rpc/tcp wait root ${PREFIX}/bin/fam fam
