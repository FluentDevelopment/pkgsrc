You can find some useful scripts to create, update and drop the necessary
databases, privileges and tables in ${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/.

If you're upgrading to ${PKGNAME_NOREV} from 1.36.x or earlier, you MUST either
recreate your catalog database or upgrade your old database using the
${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/upgrade_bacula_tables script.

Also you can not use an older file daemon with the newer director daemon,
so you must upgrade any bacula-clientonly installations as well.
