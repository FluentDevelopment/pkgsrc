You'll have to install pkgsrc/sysutils/grub with the option "GRUB_ISO9660"
enabled to use mklivecd, so you'll be able to boot big kernels or 
multiple kernels via grub.

For example, if you want to boot a kernel called "mykernel", in the grub
shell, you should to type:

grub> kernel --type=netbsd /mykernel
grub> boot

And the kernel will be loaded correctly. Good luck!.
