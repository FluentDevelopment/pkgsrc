To configure Webmin for the first time or to upgrade, you will need to
run the following command as ${ROOT_USER}:

	${WEBMIN_DIR}/setup.sh

If you are configuring Webmin for the first time, then you can safely
accept all of the defaults for options prompted by the setup script.

This is a minimal installation of Webmin.  You will want to install
Webmin modules from within Webmin itself for the systems and services
you wish to administer.
