This is a small KDE applet showing the load average graph on the
panel. You can customize colors and the refresh rate.  It also allows one
to execute a command on receiving a mouse click.

After starting, it puts itself in the docking area on the panel. If
session support is enabled, it will restart itself the next time the user9
logs in.

Pressing the right mouse button shows the menu.  Pressing the left mouse
button executes the configured command.
