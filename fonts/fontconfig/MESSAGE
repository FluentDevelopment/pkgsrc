You will need to run 'fc-cache' as root to build the X11 font cache
before attempting to use applications which use ${PKGNAME}.

Note that 'fc-cache' can take a VERY long time to complete depending
on your system speed and the fonts you have available. You may wish to
use the -v flag for some verbosity.
