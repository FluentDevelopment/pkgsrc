Gnus is a newsreader and mail reader for Emacs. It is astonishingly
flexible and powerful in dealing with large amounts of news and mail.

The Gnus package replaces the version of Gnus that comes with the normal
gnu emacs distribution with a much more up to date one. The package
is not needed with xemacs -- a new gnus is included in xemacs-packages.
