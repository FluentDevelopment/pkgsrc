	GNATS - GNU Problem Report Management System

This directory contains GNATS, a problem tracking system written to
help report on, and track, problem reports or bugs. GNATS is currently
in use at Cygnus to help track all incoming bug reports.  There are
many concepts or approaches to GNATS which are only useful to
organizations which track bugs related by customers as well as by bug
type.

You will want to add a user entry to your /etc/passwd file for the user-id
that owns gnats-related databases on your server. Something of the form:

    gnats:*:61:61:GNATS database owner:/usr/pkg/share/gnats/gnats-db:/bin/sh

should do just fine (put it in your ftpusers file!). Then add the following
line to /etc/inetd.conf and restart inetd:

    support stream tcp nowait gnats /usr/pkg/libexec/gnats/gnatsd gnatsd

Add something like this into the a crontab for 'gnats' to process
incoming bug reports:

    */5 * * * * /usr/pkg/libexec/gnats/queue-pr -r

or in /etc/crontab as:

    */5 * * * * gnats /usr/pkg/libexec/gnats/queue-pr -r
      
To accept PRs by mail you'll want some new aliases too:

	gnats-admin:	postmaster
	bugs:		"| /usr/pkg/libexec/gnats/queue-pr -q"
	query-pr:	"| /usr/pkg/libexec/gnats/mail-query"

Don't forget to run /usr/pkg/libexec/gnats/mkcat as gnats.
