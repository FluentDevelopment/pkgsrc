PL/Python allows you to write functions in the Python programming language
that may be used in SQL queries as if they were built into Postgres.
The PL/Python intepreter is a full Python interpreter.

As of PostgreSQL 7.4, PL/Python is only available as an "untrusted"
language (meaning it does not offer any way of restricting what
users can do in it). It has therefore been renamed to plpythonu.
The trusted variant plpython may become available again in future,
if a new secure execution mechanism is developed in Python.
