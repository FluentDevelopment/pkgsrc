-0.- Licence.
-____________
-    
-GNOME Transcript is released under the GPL Licence, you should have recived
-a copy of the licence with this document, otherwise see www.gnu.org
-
-
-1.- Introduccion.
-_________________
-
-GNOME Transcript is a client for SQL databases, currently supporting
-PosgreSQL only, but I have plans for MySQL an MSQL.
-GNOME Transcript aims to provide an easy enviroment for the novice user
-of SQL databases, providing gui replacements for some of the SQL commands,
-and a powerfull, environment for the experienced user, with SQL engines.
-In this stages, the early stages, you can see what the environment for the
-novice users will be about, but the engines for the experiences user are
-missing but are soon to come.
-GNOME Transcript may be, and surely is unstable, and a lot of planned
-features are missing.
-Other thing you must be aware of is that GNOME Transcript does not allows you
-to work with regular tables at this stages (this will change soon),
-instead it provides you with an editor for creating special GTransTables.
-Read the next to find out more about GTransTables.
-
-
-
-
-2.- GTransTables
-________________
-
-GTransTables are tables, with special config that allows you to edit
-view and update you data in a special gui environment that you design
-with the table editor, GNOME Transcript will also support regular
-tables in a upcoming version.
-
-How is it posible for GNOME Transcript to store a configuration for
-this special and beautiful user designed tables????
-The first time GNOME Transcript connects to a database creates
-a table named GTransTables, where the record for the supported tables
-will be kept, and for each table you create it creates a table for
-storing its configuration, this way you have the config right where
-you kept the data. If you create a table that is named \"CompactDiscs\"
-this table will be created as a regular table, but a table named
-\"CompactDiscs_def\" will be created to store the configuration.
-
-*** IMPORTANT ***
-Do not try to name your tables with spaces in between, like
-\"Compact Discs\", or with characters like (.,:-+) and that stuff
-like \"Compact-Discs.\"
-This version does not supports that.
-
-
-
-
-3.- When to use GNOME Transcript.
-_________________________________
-
-This version is all about to see if the special gui's could be created and
-used with regularity, fortunately this works fine, but this version
-is also missing serious database support, for example when you create
-a table, all field are type text (this will change soon), so dont use
-GNOME Transcript for data that the field must be floats and that stuff.
-
-One good use that GNOME Transcript serves perfectly well in this version is
-an addres book, a recipy book, and that kind of stuff.
-
-
-
-
-4.- Overview.
-_____________
-
-Ok lets see how to use this program.
-
-First of all whe have menus and a toolbar, let see the menus.
-
-*** File Menu.
-	
-	* New 	: Starts the GTransTable editor for you to create a new
-		  table, later we will see more about this editor.
-	
-	* Open  : Opens a GTransTable for editing, here the config file
-		  is a regular file, this is so you could also store
-		  table in regular files and interchange them with
-		  you closest friends.
-		  This is miising a lot of support, dont use field
-		  names longer than 255 characters or use ':' in the
-		  field name.
-		  
-	* Save  : Saves a GTransTable from the editor to a regular
-		  file.
-		  This is miising a lot of support, dont use field
-		  names longer than 255 characters or use ':' in the
-		  field name.
-		  
-	* Close : Closes the table being edited.
-	
-	* Quit  : Just quits.
-    
-
-*** Database Menu.
-
-	* Connect    : Starts a connection to a database only supports
-		       single connection, but in version 0.0.2, we  will
-		       have multiple connections to multiple databases.
-		     
-	* Disconnect : Finishes the current connection.
-	
-	* Open       : Opens a table for editing, this one opens
-		       the config from the database.
-		       
-	* Save       : Saves the GTransTable being edited, also sets
-		       the record for the supported table, and creates 
-		       the actual table.
-		    
-	* Save As    : Same as above, but always asks for a name.
-	
-	* Select *   : Selects al registers from a table and displays them
-		       guily, ready for you to do some actual work.
-		       
-	* Delete     : deletes a supported table from the database.
-	
-
-*** Help.
-	
-	* About      : the usual about box.
-	
-
-
-
-
-5.- Connections.
-________________
-
-When ever you want to connect to a data base, a special connection dialog
-will be poped right infront of your eyes asking for the next info.
-
-    Database :  The name of the database you wish to connect to,
-		This field can be null, if so the connection
-		will be made, to a databease named as the user.
-		
-    Host     :  The host wuere posgres is running, if null
-		it connects to the localhost.
-		
-    Port     :  The port to connect to, can be null and uses 
-		some kind of default.
-		
-    Username :  The name of the Posgtres user, this one cant be null
-	    	and the user must apear on pg_shadow, read the postgres
-		manual for more info.
-		
-    Pasword  :  Pasword for the user, it can be null if the user is using
-		a db he created.
-		
-    tty      :  for special debuging info, can be null.
-    
-
-
-
-    
-6.- Creating and editing GTransTables.
-______________________________________
-
-To do this you must first start the editor ( see Overview to find out
-how to do that).
-Then in the main aplication the editor will apear. This editor consists
-in a tree displayed in the left side, some buttons in the middle and
-a preview in the right side.
-
-** The GTransItems.
-
-The GtransItems are the items (widgets) you use to define you table.
-The currently available items are, Pages, Labeled Texts, Labeled Entrys,
-FramedHBox and FramedVBox.
-
-*Pages are those things, like pages that you can very oftenly see in any
-aplication, this page may only go in the root of the tree, i mean the
-higher part of the struct ans not contained in any other item, this 
-will be more clear after an example.
-
-*Labeled Texts are fileds for inserting large texts, that come with
-a label acording to its name.
-
-*Labeled Entrys are fileds for inserting a line of text, that come with
-a label acording to its name.
-
-* FramedHBox, this widget is a container, this means yo can insert other 
-items in it, this framed box allows you to insert items and this items
-are piled from left to right.
-
-* FramedVBox, this widget is a container, this means yo can insert other 
-items in it, this framed box allows you to insert items and this items
-are piled from top to bottom.
-
-
-** The tree **
-The tree is for viewing and accesing the widget structure. 
-
-For example, press the button that is labeled with the word \"Page\",
-you will see that in the tree an item apears, and also in the preview
-Pages are inserted always at the top of the tree, and not in subtrees.
-Before the page is inserted it will ask you fir a name, this name must
-not bee null and must not exist in the table.
-
-Then, select the page from the tree with a click of the left mouse
-button. And then press the button labled with \"FVBox\", again
-a name will be asked, after the name has been validated,
-the FVbox will be inserted in the preview, to see it in
-the tree you will have to expand the pafe from the tree
-by clicking on the + sign on the item and then you will see
-the FVBox in the tree.
-
-Then select the FVbox from the tree and press the button entry,
-and after you have named it it will apear in the tree (you must expand 
-the FVBox to see it) and in the preview.
-
-The rules are very simple, all pages go in the root tree, so you
-don need to select a container for it, and for the other items
-you do must select a container.
-Names must not be null and must not exist in the table.
-
-To Remove an item, just select it from the tree and click the remove
-button, this item and all its children will be removed.
-
-You can add as much as pages to the root tree and as much items to
-the container as you wish.
-You can open some expamles for editing from files that come in this
-distibution, you will pobably find them in
-$(prefix)/share/gtranscript/examples/
-where prefix is the installation prefix you selected.
-You will have to open this examples with the \"Open\" command that
-apears in the File menu in GNOME Transcript.
-
-
-
-
-
-7.- Working with the Tables.
-____________________________
-
-To work with the tables you created, one you have created a table you
-must saveit into the database, this, with the \"Save\", \"Save As\" commands
-that apear in the Database menu on the main window.
-
-Once the table is created, and saved, from the database menu, select
-\"Select *\", and a dialog for you to select a table will be poped,
-all the tables listed there a GTransSupported, if you dont see any
-table either something happened when saving the table, or you forgot
-to save the table to the database. If the first happened, mail me.
-
-Once you selected you table, a window will be poped, its a list
-that one column for each field.
-Click the button new, from the window that has just been poped,
-and surprise, there is the table you defined, insert some data
-and hit ok, the new member must be added to the list.
-Add some more stuff.
-
-Then select a member from the list and click the button \"View\",
-and you see the member as you defined it.
-
-Then select a member and click the button \"Update\", and a window
-with the struct you defined will be poped, change the data and
-click \"OK\", and the data is changed.
-
-Then select a row from the list, and click \"Delete\", the member will
-be poped, if you click \"OK\" then it will be deleted, but you can cancel
-it.
-
-You can select as many tables as you want at the same time, but they must
-be from the same connection to the database, if while working
-with the list somethibng happens to the connection is better to
-close the window, reconnect and select the table again.
-In version 0.0.2, you will be able to select as many tables as you want
-from as many databases as you want at the same time.
-
-

-
-Hello, that is me.
-If you find a bug, you have any suggestions, you want to donate some
-code, you want to help with this patetic documentation. please
-contact me, you can doit by mailing me at <matias@linuxbox.com>
-The GNOME Transcript Home Page is located in
