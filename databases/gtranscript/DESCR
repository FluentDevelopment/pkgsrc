  GNOME Transcript is a SQL Database Client (currently PostgreSQL), designed
to provide a friendly and powerful environment for the database user.  It's
currently in it's early stages and a lot (and I mean a LOT) of planned
features are missing but it's usable.

  Features:

    * Design the tables you want, and the way the info displayed 

    * Add, Update, View, and Delete from the table using the struct you
      designed
