Do *not* edit "${PMDIR}/config.inc.php" to customize
this package because it is a link which will removed during upgrades.
The actual configuration file is "${PMCONFFILE}".

You will need to make phpMyAdmin accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:
       
	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/phpmyadmin.conf

to make phpMyAdmin accessible through:
				
	http://www.domain.com/phpmyadmin/
