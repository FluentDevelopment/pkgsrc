Do *not* edit "${PREFIX}/share/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php" to customize
this package because it is a link which will removed during upgrades.
The actual configuration file is "${PMCONFFILE}".

You will need to make phpMyAdmin accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you may either symlink
       
	${PMDIR}

into DocumentRoot, or copy

	${EXDIR}/phpmyadmin.conf

to ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/httpd and add the following line to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/httpd/phpmyadmin.conf

to make mySQL accessible through:
				
	http://www.domain.com/phpmyadmin/
