Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator.

From the web page (http://www.swig.org):

SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written
in C, C++, and Objective-C with a variety of high-level programming
languages. SWIG is primarily used with common scripting languages
such as Perl, Python, and Tcl/Tk, but has also been extended to
include languages such as Java, Eiffel, and Guile. SWIG is most
commonly used to create high-level interpreted programming
environments, systems integration, and as a tool for building user
interfaces. SWIG is distributed as OpenSource and may be freely
used, distributed, and modified for commercial or noncommercial
use.
