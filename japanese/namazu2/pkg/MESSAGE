$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.4 2001/08/21 14:01:19 taca Exp $

*WARNING*:

1. Index file format has changed since namazu 2.0.  If you upgrade
   from namazu 1.X, you need to rebuild index files.

2. In order to processing Japanese, you need to set "LC_ALL", "LANG"
   or "LC_CTYPE" environment to "ja".  Or use --indexing-lang option
   of mknmz.

3. In order to display Japanese message, you need to set "LANGUAGE",
   "LC_ALL", "LC_MESSAGES" or "LANG" environment to "ja".

4. Because of lack of locale support, you need to set "PERL_BADLANG"
   for perl to stop the warning on NetBSD 1.5.X and before.
   On NetBSD current (1.6 or later), you don't need to set
   "PERL_BADLANG" but "LC_LANG" environment.
